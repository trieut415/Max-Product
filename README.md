The function Max-Product accepts an input file containing sequences of integers, where each sequence starts on a new line, and may continue on several subsequent lines, containing at most 100 members, and ends with the number -999999 (which is not part of the given sequence)
The function outputs to the screen the maximum contiguous sub-sequence product of up to 3 numbers for each sequence, one output per line. A contiguous sub-sequence is a sequence of 1,2, or 3 numbers that are consecutive in the input. It returns the maximum of all the outputs.

Sample input:

1 2 3 -999999
-5 -2 -2 -30 -999999
6 9 -10 1 -999999
